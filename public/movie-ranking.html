<h1>Ash's Movie Review</h1>

<h2>My most recently watched movies</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Captain America: Brave New World</h3>
<p>Actually suprised me. Never thought much of Falcon tbh, but I can see that he is very proficient with the shield</p>
<h3>Mufasa: The Lion King</h3>
<p>I liked this movie a lot. Obviously similar to previous Lion King movies. I wish they had an animated version.</p>
<h3>Sonic The Hedgehog 3</h3>
<p>I haven't seen the previous two movies. I walked in during a scene while it was playing and decided to watch it later that week. Shadow is overpowered, I can see why he was put to sleep for 50 years.</p>
